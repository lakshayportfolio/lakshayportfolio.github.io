                    <strong>Voltas' Market:</strong> India’s AC market was valued at &#8377;30,720 crores in FY22. It is expected to grow at at 8% CAGR during the next 10 years period, inspite of Covid-19 headwinds for two years. The Government’s PLI Scheme on White Goods is designed to create a complete component ecosystem for the Air Conditioner industry in India. Over the next five years, the scheme is expected to lead to the total production of about &#8377;2,71,000 crores of components of ACs and LEDs.<br><br>

                    Global MEP (Electromechanical) Industry was valued at &#8377;140,560 crores in FY22. It is expected to grow at 5.79% CAGR during the next 10 years period. Voltas major MEP business happens in the Middle East (subsidiaries of Voltas Ltd). On the other hand, Engineering Product Services market is valued at &#8377;35,000 crores in FY22.<br><br>

                    India’s GDP is estimated to be 8.9% in FY22 against a contraction of 6.6% in FY21. As Middle East accounts 34% of revenues of Voltas, Middle East GDP Growth becomes a main driving factor. The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is likely to witness a GDP growth of 5.0% in 2022 compared to 5.8% in 2021. The growth drivers will be higher oil output and recovery in non-oil sectors.<br><br>

					<strong>Air Conditioners Industry:</strong> People in India do purchase consumer durables based on word-of-mouth, same goes for Air Conditioners. One bad experience can lead to customers shifting to other brands. Air Conditioners usually require high maintainence cost (service cost, gas leakages, motor dysfunction). Just for context, a gas leakage can cost around Rs. 2,500. A front coil replacement cost upto Rs. 4,500. Regular Service charge is around Rs. 500. The industry is built on After Sales Service. A bad and expensive experience will lead to customer shifting to other brands.<br><br>

					<strong>Nature of Product/Service and Customer Habits:</strong> People buy air conditioners once in every 5 to 7 years. It's a basic need in Urban Households and Commercials. Being under air conditioners becomes a habit for consumers, the industry will grow rapidly as more and more people gets a habit of being under air conditioners.<br><br>

					<strong>Voltas' Competition, Strengths and Weakness:</strong> Competition comes from Blue Star, Amber Enterprises and Hitachi (Johnson Controls). Voltas Ltd is already a big player in the AC Industry. They earn more than their cost of capital of 8.11%. One of their weakness is risky Middle East projects, which affects about one-thirds of company's revenues.<br><br>

                    <span class="head1">My Narrative and Valuation</span><br><br>

                    Based on the key pointers and fundamentals, here are some forecasts and judgements that I made to value Voltas Ltd. It can be wrong, it's a forecast overall!<br><br>

                    <strong>1) The Market Size:</strong> The Air conditioners market is aim to sell about 165 lakh units by FY25 (90 lakh in FY22). The mechanical and electromechanical market was valued at $17.57 billion in 2022 to cross 24.63 billion by 2027. Expected to grow at a CAGR of over 5.79% during the period 2021−2027 ~ Arizton. Market size of textile machinery stood at Rs.35,000 crores (US$ 5.4 billion) in 2021. Textile industry exports stood at Rs. 3,307 crores in 2020-21, as against Rs 2,556 crores achieved during 2019-20 ~ IBEF India.<br><br>

                    <span id="dcf"><img class="dcf-image" src="assets/img/portfolio/voltas-dcf/voltas_rev.jpg"></span><br><br>

                    <strong>2) The Market Share:</strong> Voltas Ltd has a market share of 15.89% in the AC Market, 1.76% in Global MEP Market and 1.40% in Engineering Products Market. Voltas Ltd already has a big presence in air conditioner industry. I have valued Voltas majorly on being one of the top players of an oligopoly market. I believe they can take 20% market share (current 15%) of the total air conditioner market. Why 20%? The air conditioner market is already very fragmented and has multiple players. My prediction - 5 players and 20% each! Talking about MEP and Engineering Products markets, I gave Voltas 2% of Global Market in MEP and 1.80% of Engineering Products, which is due to fact that they have 60% market share in spinning machinery production.<br><br>

                    <strong>3) Revenues:</strong> Voltas' revenues consists of the 3 revenue segments and other category, which made 1.19% revenues of total revenues in FY22. The revenues is the sum of three revenue segments plus the other category which I capped at 1%. Growth Rate (CAGR) is 12.09% for the next 10 years.<br><br>

                    <strong>4) Operating Margin:</strong> There is no real story about the operating margins. Consumer Durables is a very competitive market and you cannot pull out high Operating Margins even if you have a good brand name, like Voltas. So, I believe Voltas will keep their operating margins around 10%.<br><br>

                    <strong>5) Reinvestment:</strong> AC Business is all about manufacturing and selling aka capital intensive. Voltas Ltd has been efficient enough in their operations and making &#8377;&#8377;1.67 of Sales for every &#8377;1 of Invested Capital. For the last 2-3 years, Voltas Ltd has been reinvesting very little in Working Capital and Capital Expenditure. Maybe it was because of the pandemic. So, I have given them an industry average reinvestment needs, which is &#8377;3.06 for every &#8377;1 of capital invested. They would need to invest about Rs. 395 cr per annum for the next 10 years to increase their Return on Capital to 16.22%. Voltas Ltd has reinvested 8.5% of their earnings in FY22 and I don't see this trend continuing.<br><br>

                    <strong>6) The Cost of Capital:</strong> I used CAPM model to find out the Cost of Equity of 8.17% and risk premiums add-ons (India + Middle East + Singapore + Market + Company) to calculate the Cost of Debt of 6.61% (ICRA Rating - AA+). The overall cost of capital (WACC), that I came up with is 8.11% based on capital structure of debt and equity, which is mostly equity.<br><br><br>

                    <span id="dcf"><img class="dcf-image" src="assets/img/portfolio/voltas-dcf/value.jpg"></span><br><br>

                    Based on the narrative I explained above, I came up with a fair value of &#8377;513.62 per share. Voltas's Stock is trading at &#8377;956.85 per share (July 12, 2022).<br><br>
