                    Muthoot Finance is a gold loan NBFC (Non-banking financial company). In fact, it is India’s largest gold loan NBFC (in terms of loan portfolio). It lends to its customers against gold jewelry as collateral. Muthoot Finance faces competition from other gold loan NBFCs (Manapurram Finance, Muthoot Fincorp), Banks, and unorganized players.<br><br>

                    <strong>Muthoot Finance Financial Highlights:</strong> I look at four crucial numbers to gauge an NBFC performance. Return on Asset (ROA), Net Interest Margin (%), Interest Spread (Interest Income on Average Loan Assets minus Interest Expenses on Average Outside Liabilities) and Gold Loan Assets under management in the case of Muthoot Finance. The four numbers are pretty good at gauging what's happening within an NBFC.<br><br>

                    Net Interest Margin has improved rapidly till FY18, but has been dropping since (13.04% in FY22), maybe due to the pandemic. Same goes for Interest Spread which has followed a similar path to NIM% (11.99% in FY22). Return on Assets has been steadily increasing to upto 7.24% in FY22. Gold Loan Assets becomes an important commodity as Muthoot Finance deals in lending money against gold/jewellery as collateral.<br><br>

                    <span id="dcf"><img class="dcf-image" src="assets/img/portfolio/muthoot-dcf/fin_high.jpg"></span><br><br>

                    <strong>Gold Loan Market:</strong> The Indian gold loan market is divided into two segments— organised and unorganised. The organised gold loan market includes banks (public, private, co-operative, and small finance banks), NBFCs, and Nidhi companies, while the unorganised gold loan segment comprises individuals who provide secured loans to borrowers by keeping gold as collateral. The organised gold loan markets though still constitute only minority of the overall Indian gold loan market which is expected to grow exponentially during 2021-25 because of the growing number of financial institutions providing gold loans to the underbanked population. In the organised gold loan segment, NBFCs dominate the market because of their quick loan processing, systematic gold valuation, and safe keeping.<br><br>

                    Downward fluctuation in gold prices could lead to loss of profits. To address this risk, Muthoot Finance has a policy of retaining at least 25% of the gold price of jewellery when calculating the loan amount, excluding design and production charges. Even if the collateral's value falls below the repayment amount, the sentimental value of gold jewellery drives repayment and redemption.<br><br>

                    <strong>Competition:</strong> Muthoot Finance is not just competing against other gold loan lenders (Manapurram Finance, Muthoot Fincorp) but also other financial services providers that deal in unsecured loans – providing the customers the option of availing funds without providing any collateral. At the same time, lenders are partnering with fintech companies to onboard unsecured loan customers.<br><br>

                    <strong>Muthoot and Gold Relationship:</strong> Due to rapid increase in gold prices, Muthoot grew their branch network >7.4x in a period of 6-years, from 551 branches in FY07 to &#8377;4,082 in FY13. During this period, AUM grew at >62% CAGR reaching &#8377;26,000 Cr. in FY13 from &#8377;1,420 Cr. in FY07. Gold tonnage increased to 134 ton in FY13 from 23 ton in FY07. As a result, RBI removed priority sector status for gold financiers in March 2012 and further reduced loan to value ratio to 60% for NBFCs vs 85% for banks. This was later normalized to the previous limit in September 2013. Bottom Line is, Muthoot Finance is tied to Gold.<br><br>

                    When a company is tied to a commodity like Gold, the obvious question to ask is. What happens to company's revenues if the gold prices change? And shouldn't it be better to buy gold instead of the company if it's as safe as Gold?<br><br>

                    So, I ran a regression of Muthoot Finance’s Revenues to the Gold Prices (per g). I took the quarterly revenues and gold prices from June 2011 to March 2022. The R-Squared is 88.15% which means gold prices do strongly affect Muthoot Finance’s Revenues. I came up with a conclusion that every rupee increase in Gold Price (per gram) will result in Rs. 7.05 increase in Muthoot Finance’s Revenues. Look at the numbers and relationship chart below:<br><br>

                    <span id="dcf"><img class="dcf-image" src="assets/img/portfolio/muthoot-dcf/reg_res.jpg"></span><br><br>

                    <strong>Potential Opportunities:</strong> Customers demand smart solutions, immediate credits, and a flawless verification procedure, all of which makes a great opportunity to go digital. 33.8% of gold loan customers are transacting online (including Paytm, PhonePe & Google Pay). Muthoot Finance has launched Loan at Home App in July 2020, which is an app-based digital service with which a customer can apply for a gold loan through the ‘Loan at Home’ mobile app and web portal.<br><br>

                    <span class="head1">My Narrative and Valuation</span><br><br>

                    Right now, these might look all over the place. Here is my narrative after gauging the fundamentals. I will be doing a Equity (FCFE) Valuation of Muthoot Finance:<br><br>

                    <strong>1) The Industry Numbers:</strong> Below I have taken an industry average Tier 1 Capital and average ROE (Return on Equity) which I am going to use while valuing Muthoot Finance Tier 1 Capital and efficiency. Tier 1 Capital Ratio (Industry Average) is 21.80% and Expected ROE (Industry Average) is 18.18%.<br><br>

                    <span id="dcf"><img class="dcf-image" src="assets/img/portfolio/muthoot-dcf/ind.jpg"></span><br><br>

                    <strong>2) Growth in Risk Weighted Assets:</strong> I believe Muthoot Finance will be able to improve their gold portfolio in the next 10 years at a CAGR of 7.46%. From year 6, I have given Muthoot Finance a growth equal to inflation (5.58%). So, basically, it's a five year growth period in RWA. At Year 10, Muthoot Finance reaches to around &#8377;1,400,482.58 crores.<br><br>

                    <strong>3) Tier 1 Capital Ratio:</strong> The industry average Tier 1 capital ratio is 21.80%, which is below Muthoot Finance's current Tier 1%. So, I have converged their Tier 1 Capital to industry average. Maybe it's understating Muthoot Finance financials, but I don't see any sustainable competitive advantages which can keep them being over the industry average.<br><br>

                    <strong>4) Expected Return on Equity (ROE):</strong> The industry average ROE (Return on Equity) is 18.18%. The Return on Equity has been fluctuating all over the place in the last few years. From 22.4% in FY19, 28.26% in FY20, 27.77% in FY21 and 21.5% in FY22. I have dealt with fluctuations with industry average ROE.<br><br>

                    <strong>5) Cost of Equity:</strong> I used CAPM model to find out the Cost of Equity. Risk Free Rate (5.58%), Muthoot Finance's Beta (1.36) and Equity Risk Premium (3.94%). Cost of Equity comes out to be 10.94%.<br><br>

                    Based on the narrative I explained above, I came up with a fair value of &#8377;1,143.96 per share. Muthoot Finance's Stock is trading at &#8377;1,025.30 per share (July 20, 2022).<br><br>
