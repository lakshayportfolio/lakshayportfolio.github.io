                    <span id="dcf"><img class="dcf-image" src="assets/img/portfolio/pepsico-dcf/Segment.jpg"></span><br><br>

                    <strong>Competition:</strong> Their beverage and convenient food products are in highly competitive categories and markets and compete against products of international beverage and convenient food companies. The coca-cola company is their primary beverage competitor.<br><br>

                    Other beverages and Convenient food Competitors include:<br>
                    • Campbell Soup Company <br>
                    • Conagra Brands<br>
                    • Keurig Dr. Pepper<br>
                    • Monster Beverage Corporation<br>
                    • Kellogg Company<br>
                    • Mondelez International <br>
                    • Kraft Heinz Company <br><br>

                    <strong>Growth:</strong> The area of growth opportunity lies in the Sports drinks category as per the latest management Con Call and their bet lies on Gatorade which now has brand equity stronger than ever.
                    They have just launched BAYA Energy which is a full natural energy brand, a new brand to the system. It's the first time they have launched it both in retail and in Starbucks Outlets.<br><br>

                    Two years ago they also have acquired Rockstar which unlocked the energy Platform, an advantage PepsiCo has over competitors, they now will be targeting 70 markets as 23 from the previous year which will help in the growth of Top Line.<br><br>

                    <strong>Competitive Advantage:</strong>  Their beverage and convenient food products compete primarily based on brand recognition and loyalty, taste, price, value, quality, product variety, innovation, distribution, advertising, marketing and promotional activity (including digital), packaging, convenience, service and the ability to anticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences and trends, including increased consumer focus on health and wellness and sustainability and the continued acceleration of e-commerce and other methods of distributing and purchasing products.<br><br>

                    <span class="head1">My Narrative and Valuation</span><br><br>

                    <strong>1) Moat Theory:</strong> Pepsi as a brand itself is the biggest Moat, it commands a strong global presence Pepsi has mastered this art to meet consumer demand around the world. Its supply chain processes ensure that shelves are never empty and that Pepsi can meet customer cravings at any time which acts as a competitive advantage over other players in the industry.<br><br>

                    <strong>2) Revenue Segments: </strong> The mentioned company operates in various geographic segments of which almost 60% is generated within North America and 40% is derived from the rest of the world, which is also affected by foreign exchange exposure. So, we have performed trend analysis on each segment and have removed the effect of foreign exchange gains and losses to get Normalised Sales i.e., Organic growth Rate.<br><br>

                    <strong>3) Operating Profit Margins: </strong> Companies that have strong brand Value Command a good margin which easily can be seen in the case of PEPSICO they have maintained a healthy margin of 14%-16%. Although the margins have been declining due to inflationary pressure on inputs cost which cannot be transferred to consumers due to the elasticity of products offered but as per the latest Con Call management is working towards having sustainable margins.<br><br>

                    <span id="dcf"><img class="dcf-image" src="assets/img/portfolio/pepsico-dcf/EBIT.jpg"></span><br><br>

                    <strong>4) Cost of Capital: </strong> Cost of equity is calculated using the CAPM approach under which risk premium is calculated using Market premium based on the return of NYSE, Beta is calculated using two approaches namely Regression Beta and Bottoms up Beta based on the average business risk in the industry, consider only those Beta whose R-square is more than 50%. The cost of debt is calculated based on the current rating of the company at 2.2% (post-tax). The overall Cost of Capital calculated ranges from 4.76% to 5.75%.<br><br>

                    <span id="dcf"><img class="dcf-image" src="assets/img/portfolio/pepsico-dcf/DCFValue.jpg"></span><br><br>

                    Based on the Narrative and assumptions above we came up with the fair value of $155 per share. PEPSICO is trading at $171.45 per share.<br><br>
