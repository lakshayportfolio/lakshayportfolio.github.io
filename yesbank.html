                    Yes Bank Limited is a distressed private sector bank. The Bank is engaged in providing banking services, including corporate and institutional banking, financial markets, investment banking, corporate finance, branch banking, business and transaction banking, and wealth management.<br><br>

                    The strong push towards business generation has in no way taken away the focus on improving loan book quality, with the GNPA ratio improving to 13.9% and PCR, including technical write-offs, at 81.5%. Witnessed YoY growth of 118% in terms of volume and 111.7% in terms of value in UPI transactions. The Bank processed overall 1,974 crore transactions with value of &#8377;3,754,392 crore, capturing 43% market share in the ecosystem.<br><br>

                    The primary reason for bank's high GNPA ratio is the NPAs of its corporate advances. The bank has some high value NPA accounts viz. Anil Ambani Group, Subhash Chandra's Essel Group, DHFL, Il&FS, Jet Airways, Cox & Kings, Go travels, McLeod Russel, Omkar Realtors, Radius Developers and CG Power. Total value of these loans taken by these groups which turned bad is &#8377;35,000 crores. These Corporate defaults were the primary reason for the crisis in the bank.<br><br>

                    On 14th March 2020, to protect the YES Bank from collapsing, many private and public institutions invested equity into the bank in March 2020. They were allotted equity shares of FV &#8377;2 each for &#8377;10 per share. 75% of equity shares allotted to each investor should be locked in for a period of 3 years. Also, shareholding of SBI in the bank shall not go below 26% for a period of 3 years starting March 2020 as per the reconstruction Scheme.<br><br>

                    As a result of reconstruction scheme and the FPO, the company's equity capital increased from &#8377;500 croresÂ to &#8377;5,000 crores. Almost all 4,500 crores of equity were allotted at a price of &#8377;10 and &#8377;12 per share.<br><br>

                    <strong>Yes Bank's Financial Highlights:</strong> To check whether a bank is doing well or not, I usually check the Return on Equity (ROE), Net NPA % (Net Non-Performing Assets %), Net Interest Margin (%) and Tier 1 Capital Adequacy Ratio (CET1 Ratio). The four numbers are pretty good at gauging what's happening within a bank.<br><br>

                    Return on Equity has recovered from last 3 years, 3.2% in FY22. Net NPA % has no real pattern ranging from 6% to 4%, which should be the biggest priority for Yes Bank now. Net Interest Margin has been ranging from 2% to 3%. And the major advancement for Yes Bank has been their Tier 1 capital ratio which is 11.6% in FY22.<br><br>

                    <strong>Regulatory Capital:</strong> Capital Adequacy Ratio of your Bank stood at 17.4% as at March 31, 2022 as compared to 17.5% as at March 31, 2021. CET-1 /Tier I Capital Ratio at 11.6% and Tier II Capital Ratio was 5.8% as at March 31, 2022. The Bank has also put in place a Board approved policy on Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) which defines and sets processes to review and improve the techniques used for identification, measurement and assessment of all material risks and resultant capital requirements.<br><br>

                    <span class="head1">Price to Book Multiple Valuation</span><br><br>

                    Here is my relative valuation of Yes Bank using the Price to Book Multiple as my basis. My value drivers are Tier 1 Capital Ratio, return on equity and Standard Deviation in stock price. I used a regression model to find out a Predicted Price to Book for Yes Bank:<br><br>

                    <span id="dcf"><img class="dcf-image" src="assets/img/portfolio/yesbank-rv/yes_rev.jpg"></span><br><br>

                    <span id="dcf"><img class="dcf-image" src="assets/img/portfolio/yesbank-rv/yesbank_price.jpg"></span><br><br>

                    With an R Squared of 74.75%, I came up with a fair value of &#8377;12.41 per share. Yes Bank's Stock was trading at &#8377;14.99 per share (July 31, 2022).<br><br>
